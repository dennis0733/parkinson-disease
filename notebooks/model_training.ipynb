    "## Model Training  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on transforming the dataset and training predictive models to estimate the unbiased OFF motor score for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:  \n",
    "1. **Feature Transformation**: Apply necessary scaling, encoding, and polynomial interactions if needed.  \n",
    "2. **Model Selection & Training**: Train multiple regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.  \n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using grid search or cross-validation.  \n",
    "4. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Assess models using RMSE, feature importance, and residual analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:  \n",
    "- Develop an interpretable, robust model for unbiased OFF score prediction.  \n",
    "- Compare different regressors and select the most effective one for the task.  \n"

    "### Data Splitting, Transformation, and Encoding Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Splitting with GroupShuffleSplit:**\n",
    "   - We use `GroupShuffleSplit` to split our data into 5 different train-test splits. The splitting is done based on `patient_id` to ensure that all data for a particular patient appears in either the train or the test set, preventing data leakage between the splits. The test set size is 20% of the data for each split, and the splitting process is repeated 5 times to obtain 5 distinct training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - The splits ensure that the model is trained on different subsets of the data and tested on unseen data, improving the generalizability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Transformation:**\n",
    "   - **Numerical Features Scaling:** We apply `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features (e.g., age, ledd, on/off times) to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important because many machine learning models perform better when numerical features are on the same scale.\n",
    "   - **Categorical Features Encoding:** We apply `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical features (e.g., `cohort`, `gene`) into a numerical format. This transformation creates binary columns for each unique category value, allowing the model to handle these features effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling 'sexM' Feature:**\n",
    "   - The `sexM` column is already binary (0/1), so it is added manually to the transformed data after scaling and encoding the features. This ensures that the column is kept in its original form and included in the final transformed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Storing Transformed Data:**\n",
    "   - The transformed training and testing datasets (`X_train_transformed` and `X_test_transformed`) for each fold are stored in separate lists. Similarly, the target variables (`y_train` and `y_test`) for each fold are also stored.\n",
    "   - This allows for easy access to the transformed data for each fold during model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why We Are Doing This:**\n",
    "   - **Cross-validation:** By using `GroupShuffleSplit`, we ensure that we evaluate the model using 5 different splits of the data, which helps in assessing the model's robustness and generalizability across different subsets of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Feature Transformation:** Scaling numerical features ensures that they are on a comparable scale, preventing any single feature from dominating the learning process. Encoding categorical variables allows the model to learn from them effectively.\n",
    "   - **Manual Handling of 'sexM':** Since `sexM` is a binary feature, we ensure that it remains intact by adding it back to the transformed data after encoding the other features.\n",
    "   - **Efficient Use of Data:** By storing the transformed data and target variables in lists for each fold, we ensure that the data is ready for model training and evaluation, avoiding data leakage and ensuring that each fold is properly handled during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is critical for ensuring that the model is evaluated properly and generalizes well to unseen data. By transforming and encoding the data correctly, we also improve the model's ability to learn from both numerical and categorical features. \n"
